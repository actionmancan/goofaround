## Step-by-Step Guidance
- **ALWAYS work one step at a time** - Don't move to next step until current step is verified working
- When troubleshooting, verify each step before proceeding
- For setup/testing: Follow guides step-by-step, verify success before continuing
- When user asks for help, provide ONE step at a time, wait for confirmation before next step
- Reference LIVING_ROOM_TEST_SETUP.md for step-by-step testing procedures
